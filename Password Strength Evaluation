This project focuses on understanding how password complexity impacts security by creating and testing multiple passwords with varying characteristics.
The process involved generating several passwords of different lengths and complexities, including variations in uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 
Each password was tested using an online password strength checker, and the results were recorded to analyze performance. 
For example, a simple password such as password123 (11 characters, only lowercase and numbers) scored around 15/100 and was flagged as highly insecure due to its predictability. 
Adding symbols and uppercase letters, as in P@ssw0rd (8 characters), improved the score to about 40/100 but still left the password vulnerable because it followed common patterns.
A more complex password like H@ckTh3$ystem2025 (16 characters with a mix of all character types) scored 80/100, showing strong security, while a fully random string like X!9bQw7Lp2%tE4 (14 characters) achieved a score of 95/100, indicating very strong protection.
From this evaluation, several best practices emerged: use at least 12â€“16 characters, incorporate all four character types, avoid dictionary words or personal information, and rely on password managers for storing and generating complex passwords.
In researching password security, common attack methods such as brute force (systematically guessing all combinations), dictionary attacks (trying known words and variations), and credential stuffing (reusing stolen credentials) were identified as major threats.
The findings clearly show that increasing password length and randomness significantly enhances resistance to these attacks, making complex, unique passwords essential for safeguarding digital accounts.
