# Password-strength-Evaluation

This project focuses on creating passwords of varying complexity, testing them on password strength checkers, and analyzing the results to identify best practices for strong password creation. Three passwords were created, ranging from weak to very strong, by varying the use of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, symbols, and length. These passwords were evaluated using tools such as Kaspersky Password Checker, NordPass Password Strength Tester, and HowSecureIsMyPassword.net. The evaluation results highlighted the importance of length, character diversity, unpredictability, and uniqueness in password security. The project also explores common password attacks like brute force, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing, emphasizing how complexity increases resistance to such attacks. The findings reinforce the importance of creating long, unique, and complex passwords to enhance digital security, especially when combined with multi-factor authentication (MFA).
